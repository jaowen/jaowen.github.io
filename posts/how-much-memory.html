             <h1>How many bits of epigenetic memory do cells need?</h1>

             <p>
                 The scale of epigenetic systems, in terms of the number of molecules or chemical species involved, seems badly out of proportion to what cells plausibly have to "remember" for developmental purposes.
             </p>
             <p>
                 First, how many bits of epigenetic memory are needed? I think a very generous upper bound is <strong>50 bits</strong>. There are less than $2^{50}$ cells in the human body, and obviously there are many fewer cell types (even considering possibility of "identity tag" systems like the protocadherin neural identity code). And I think not all memory of cell type needs to be encoded epigeneticallyâ€”for example, physical position of a cell within a tissue can probably also be instructive for cell type.
             </p>
             <p>
                 Second, for how many cell divisions does this memory have to last? Tomasetti/Vogelstein (2015) provide estimates of the rate of cell divisions in various tissues. In a typical lifespan, I think we are talking at most <strong>thousands of cell divisions</strong>.
             </p>
             <p>
                 So what sort of chemical system would one need to make a memory of 50 bits that lasts for 1000s of cell divisions? It should be achievable with about 50 different types of molecules, with about 20 copies of each of them. We need a total of 1000 molecules.
